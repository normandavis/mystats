* User Story Title: Input Start Paramaters
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ADDED: <2014-10-23 Thu 12:40>
  :END: 
** Described by:
*** As someone who tracks personal data daily
*** I want to input the parameters that set up the start data and the goals
*** So that information can be recovered from data to inform and influence change
** Acceptance Criteria: startup parameters persist
*** Given startup parameters were input previously
*** When new data is added
*** Then it is captured, and displayed in the context of the start and goal parameters
